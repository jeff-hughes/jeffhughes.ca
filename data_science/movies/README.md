# Movie Ratings

This is a write-up exploring a dataset from MovieLens including 20 million ratings of 27,000 movies. I take a look at the best and worst movies, best directors and screenplay writers, and look at actors' careers over time. The write-up can be found here: [http://www.jeffhughes.ca/data_science/movies/Movie-Ratings.html](http://www.jeffhughes.ca/data_science/movies/Movie-Ratings.html).
